<H1>Programming Assignment 1: Building a Multi-Threaded Web Server</H1>
<P>In this lab we will develop a Web server in two steps. In the end, you will 
have built a multi-threaded Web server that is capable of processing multiple 
simultaneous service requests in parallel. You should be able to demonstrate 
that your Web server is capable of delivering your home page to a Web browser. 
<P>We are going to implement version 1.0 of HTTP, as defined in <A 
href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1945.txt" target=_new>RFC 1945</A>, where 
separate HTTP requests are sent for each component of the Web page. The server 
will be able to handle multiple simultaneous service requests in parallel. This 
means that the Web server is multi-threaded. In the main thread, the server 
listens to a fixed port. When it receives a TCP connection request, it sets up a 
TCP connection through another port and services the request in a separate 
thread. To simplify this programming task, we will develop the code in two 
stages. In the first stage, you will write a multi-threaded server that simply 
displays the contents of the HTTP request message that it receives. After this 
program is running properly, you will add the code required to generate an 
appropriate response. 
<P>As you are developing the code, you can test your server from a Web browser. 
But remember that you are not serving through the standard port 80, so you need 
to specify the port number within the URL that you give to your browser. For 
example, if your machine's name is <CODE>host.someschool.edu</CODE>, your server 
is listening to port 6789, and you want to retrieve the file 
<CODE>index.html</CODE>, then you would specify the following URL within the 
browser: 
<P><PRE>http://host.someschool.edu:6789/index.html
</PRE>
<P>If you omit ":6789", the browser will assume port 80 which most likely will 
not have a server listening on it. 
<P>When the server encounters an error, it sends a response message with the 
appropriate HTML source so that the error information is displayed in the 
browser window. 
<P>
<H3>Web Server in Java: Part A</H3>
<P>In the following steps, we will go through the code for the first 
implementation of our Web Server. Wherever you see "?", you will need to supply 
a missing detail. 
<P>Our first implementation of the Web server will be multi-threaded, where the 
processing of each incoming request will take place inside a separate thread of 
execution. This allows the server to service multiple clients in parallel, or to 
perform multiple file transfers to a single client in parallel. When we create a 
new thread of execution, we need to pass to the Thread's constructor an instance 
of some class that implements the <CODE>Runnable</CODE> interface. This is the 
reason that we define a separate class called <CODE>HttpRequest</CODE>. The 
structure of the Web server is shown below: 
<P><PRE>import java.io.* ;
import java.net.* ;
import java.util.* ;

public final class WebServer
{
	public static void main(String argv[]) throws Exception
	{
		. . .
	}
}

final class HttpRequest implements Runnable
{
	. . .
}
</PRE>
<P>Normally, Web servers process service requests that they receive through 
well-known port number 80. You can choose any port higher than 1024, but 
remember to use the same port number when making requests to your Web server 
from your browser. 
<P><PRE>public static void main(String argv[]) throws Exception
{
	// Set the port number.
	int port = 6789;

	. . .
}
</PRE>
<P>Next, we open a socket and wait for a TCP connection request. Because we will 
be servicing request messages indefinitely, we place the listen operation inside 
of an infinite loop. This means we will have to terminate the Web server by 
pressing ^C on the keyboard. 
<P><PRE>// Establish the listen socket.
       ?

// Process HTTP service requests in an infinite loop.
while (true) {
	// Listen for a TCP connection request.
	?

	. . .
}
</PRE>
<P>When a connection request is received, we create an <CODE>HttpRequest</CODE> 
object, passing to its constructor a reference to the <CODE>Socket</CODE> object 
that represents our established connection with the client. 
<P><PRE>// Construct an object to process the HTTP request message.
HttpRequest request = new HttpRequest( ? );

// Create a new thread to process the request.
Thread thread = new Thread(request);

// Start the thread.
thread.start();
</PRE>
<P>In order to have the <CODE>HttpRequest</CODE> object handle the incoming HTTP 
service request in a separate thread, we first create a new <CODE>Thread</CODE> 
object, passing to its constructor a reference to the <CODE>HttpRequest</CODE> 
object, and then call the thread's <CODE>start()</CODE> method. 
<P>After the new thread has been created and started, execution in the main 
thread returns to the top of the message processing loop. The main thread will 
then block, waiting for another TCP connection request, while the new thread 
continues running. When another TCP connection request is received, the main 
thread goes through the same process of thread creation regardless of whether 
the previous thread has finished execution or is still running. 
<P>This completes the code in <CODE>main()</CODE>. For the remainder of the lab, 
it remains to develop the <CODE>HttpRequest</CODE> class. 
<P>We declare two variables for the HttpRequest class: <CODE>CRLF</CODE> and 
<CODE>socket</CODE>. According to the HTTP specification, we need to terminate 
each line of the server's response message with a carriage return (CR) and a 
line feed (LF), so we have defined <CODE>CRLF</CODE> as a convenience. The 
variable <CODE>socket</CODE> will be used to store a reference to the connection 
socket, which is passed to the constructor of this class. The structure of the 
HttpRequest class is shown below: 
<P><PRE>final class HttpRequest implements Runnable
{
	final static String CRLF = "\r\n";
	Socket socket;

	// Constructor
	public HttpRequest(Socket socket) throws Exception 
	{
		this.socket = socket;
	}

	// Implement the run() method of the Runnable interface.
	public void run()
	{
		. . .
	}

	private void processRequest() throws Exception
	{
		. . .
	}
}
</PRE>
<P>In order to pass an instance of the <CODE>HttpRequest</CODE> class to the 
<CODE>Thread</CODE>'s constructor, <CODE>HttpRequest</CODE> must implement the 
<CODE>Runnable</CODE> interface, which simply means that we must define a public 
method called <CODE>run()</CODE> that returns <CODE>void</CODE>. Most of the 
processing will take place within <CODE>processRequest()</CODE>, which is called 
from within <CODE>run()</CODE>. 
<P>Up until this point, we have been throwing exceptions, rather than catching 
them. However, we can not throw exceptions from <CODE>run()</CODE>, because we 
must strictly adhere to the declaration of <CODE>run()</CODE> in the 
<CODE>Runnable</CODE> interface, which does not throw any exceptions. We will 
place all the processing code in <CODE>processRequest()</CODE>, and from there, 
throw exceptions to <CODE>run()</CODE>. Within <CODE>run()</CODE>, we explicitly 
catch and handle exceptions with a try/catch block. 
<P><PRE>// Implement the run() method of the Runnable interface.
public void run()
{
	try {
		processRequest();
	} catch (Exception e) {
		System.out.println(e);
	}
}
</PRE>
<P>Now, let's develop the code within <CODE>processRequest()</CODE>. We first 
obtain references to the socket's input and output streams. Then we wrap 
<CODE>InputStreamReader</CODE> and <CODE>BufferedReader</CODE> filters around 
the input stream. However, we won't wrap any filters around the output stream, 
because we will be writing bytes directly into the output stream. 
<P><PRE>private void processRequest() throws Exception
{
	// Get a reference to the socket's input and output streams.
	InputStream is = ?;
	DataOutputStream os = ?;

	// Set up input stream filters.
	? 
	BufferedReader br = ?;

	. . .
}
</PRE>
<P>Now we are prepared to get the client's request message, which we do by 
reading from the socket's input stream. The <CODE>readLine()</CODE> method of 
the <CODE>BufferedReader</CODE> class will extract characters from the input 
stream until it reaches an end-of-line character, or in our case, the 
end-of-line character sequence CRLF. 
<P>The first item available in the input stream will be the HTTP request line. 
(See Section 2.2 of the textbook for a description of this and the following 
fields.) 
<P><PRE>// Get the request line of the HTTP request message.
String requestLine = <SPAN class=questionMark>?</SPAN>;

// Display the request line.
System.out.println();
System.out.println(requestLine);
</PRE>
<P>After obtaining the request line of the message header, we obtain the header 
lines. Since we don't know ahead of time how many header lines the client will 
send, we must get these lines within a looping operation. 
<P><PRE>// Get and display the header lines.
String headerLine = null;
while ((headerLine = br.readLine()).length() != 0) {
	System.out.println(headerLine);
}
</PRE>
<P>We don't need the header lines, other than to print them to the screen, so we 
use a temporary String variable, <CODE>headerLine</CODE>, to hold a reference to 
their values. The loop terminates when the expression 
<P><PRE>(headerLine = br.readLine()).length()
</PRE>
<P>evaluates to zero, which will occur when <CODE>headerLine</CODE> has zero 
length. This will happen when the empty line terminating the header lines is 
read. (See the HTTP Request Message diagram in Section 2.2 of the textbook) 
<P>In the next step of this lab, we will add code to analyze the client's 
request message and send a response. But before we do this, let's try compiling 
our program and testing it with a browser. Add the following lines of code to 
close the streams and socket connection. 
<P><PRE>// Close streams and socket.
os.close();
br.close();
socket.close();
</PRE>
<P>After your program successfully compiles, run it with an available port 
number, and try contacting it from a browser. To do this, you should enter into 
the browser's address text box the IP address of your running server. For 
example, if your machine name is <CODE>host.someschool.edu</CODE>, and you ran 
the server with port number 6789, then you would specify the following URL: 
<P><PRE>http://host.someschool.edu:6789/
</PRE>
<P>The server should display the contents of the HTTP request message. Check 
that it matches the message format shown in the HTTP Request Message diagram in 
Section 2.2 of the textbook. 
<P>
<H3>Web Server in Java: Part B</H3>
<P>Instead of simply terminating the thread after displaying the browser's HTTP 
request message, we will analyze the request and send an appropriate response. 
We are going to ignore the information in the header lines, and use only the 
file name contained in the request line. In fact, we are going to assume that 
the request line always specifies the GET method, and ignore the fact that the 
client may be sending some other type of request, such as HEAD or POST. 
<P>We extract the file name from the request line with the aid of the 
<CODE>StringTokenizer</CODE> class. First, we create a 
<CODE>StringTokenizer</CODE> object that contains the string of characters from 
the request line. Second, we skip over the method specification, which we have 
assumed to be "GET". Third, we extract the file name. 
<P><PRE>// Extract the filename from the request line.
StringTokenizer tokens = new StringTokenizer(requestLine);
tokens.nextToken();  // skip over the method, which should be "GET"
String fileName = tokens.nextToken();

// Prepend a "." so that file request is within the current directory.
fileName = "." + fileName;
</PRE>
<P>Because the browser precedes the filename with a slash, we prefix a dot so 
that the resulting pathname starts within the current directory. 
<P>Now that we have the file name, we can open the file as the first step in 
sending it to the client. If the file does not exist, the 
<CODE>FileInputStream()</CODE> constructor will throw the 
<CODE>FileNotFoundException</CODE>. Instead of throwing this possible exception 
and terminating the thread, we will use a try/catch construction to set the 
boolean variable <CODE>fileExists</CODE> to false. Later in the code, we will 
use this flag to construct an error response message, rather than try to send a 
nonexistent file. 
<P><PRE>// Open the requested file.
FileInputStream fis = null;
boolean fileExists = true;
try {
	fis = new FileInputStream(fileName);
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
	fileExists = false;
}
</PRE>
<P>There are three parts to the response message: the status line, the response 
headers, and the entity body. The status line and response headers are 
terminated by the character sequence CRLF. We are going to respond with a status 
line, which we store in the variable <CODE>statusLine</CODE>, and a single 
response header, which we store in the variable <CODE>contentTypeLine</CODE>. In 
the case of a request for a nonexistent file, we return <I>404 Not Found</I> in 
the status line of the response message, and include an error message in the 
form of an HTML document in the entity body. 
<P><PRE>// Construct the response message.
String statusLine = null;
String contentTypeLine = null;
String entityBody = null;
if (fileExists) {
	statusLine = <SPAN class=questionMark>?</SPAN>;
	contentTypeLine = "Content-type: " + 
		contentType( fileName ) + CRLF;
} else {
	statusLine = <SPAN class=questionMark>?</SPAN>;
	contentTypeLine = <SPAN class=questionMark>?</SPAN>;
	entityBody = "&lt;HTML&gt;" + 
		"&lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;TITLE&gt;Not Found&lt;/TITLE&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;" +
		"&lt;BODY&gt;Not Found&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;";
}
</PRE>
<P>When the file exists, we need to determine the file's MIME type and send the 
appropriate MIME-type specifier. We make this determination in a separate 
private method called <CODE>contentType()</CODE>, which returns a string that we 
can include in the content type line that we are constructing. 
<P>Now we can send the status line and our single header line to the browser by 
writing into the socket's output stream. 
<P><PRE>// Send the status line.
os.writeBytes(statusLine);

// Send the content type line.
os.writeBytes(?);

// Send a blank line to indicate the end of the header lines.
os.writeBytes(CRLF);
</PRE>
<P>Now that the status line and header line with delimiting CRLF have been 
placed into the output stream on their way to the browser, it is time to do the 
same with the entity body. If the requested file exists, we call a separate 
method to send the file. If the requested file does not exist, we send the 
HTML-encoded error message that we have prepared. 
<P><PRE>// Send the entity body.
if (fileExists)	{
	sendBytes(fis, os);
	fis.close();
} else {
	os.writeBytes(?);
}
</PRE>
<P>After sending the entity body, the work in this thread has finished, so we 
close the streams and socket before terminating. 
<P>We still need to code the two methods that we have referenced in the above 
code, namely, the method that determines the MIME type, 
<CODE>contentType()</CODE>, and the method that writes the requested file onto 
the socket's output stream. Let's first take a look at the code for sending the 
file to the client. 
<P><PRE>private static void sendBytes(FileInputStream fis, OutputStream os) 
throws Exception
{
   // Construct a 1K buffer to hold bytes on their way to the socket.
   byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];
   int bytes = 0;

   // Copy requested file into the socket's output stream.
   while((bytes = fis.read(buffer)) != -1 ) {
      os.write(buffer, 0, bytes);
   }
}
</PRE>
<P>Both <CODE>read()</CODE> and <CODE>write()</CODE> throw exceptions. Instead 
of catching these exceptions and handling them in our code, we throw them to be 
handled by the calling method. 
<P>The variable, <CODE>buffer</CODE>, is our intermediate storage space for 
bytes on their way from the file to the output stream. When we read the bytes 
from the <CODE>FileInputStream</CODE>, we check to see if <CODE>read()</CODE> 
returns minus one, indicating that the end of the file has been reached. If the 
end of the file has not been reached, <CODE>read()</CODE> returns the number of 
bytes that have been placed into <CODE>buffer</CODE>. We use the 
<CODE>write()</CODE> method of the <CODE>OutputStream</CODE> class to place 
these bytes into the output stream, passing to it the name of the byte array, 
<CODE>buffer</CODE>, the starting point in the array, <CODE>0</CODE>, and the 
number of bytes in the array to write, <CODE>bytes</CODE>. 
<P>The final piece of code needed to complete the Web server is a method that 
will examine the extension of a file name and return a string that represents 
it's MIME type. If the file extension is unknown, we return the type 
<CODE>application/octet-stream</CODE>. 
<P><PRE>private static String contentType(String fileName)
{
	if(fileName.endsWith(".htm") || fileName.endsWith(".html")) {
		return "text/html";
	}
	if(?) {
		?;
	}
	if(?) {
		?;
	}
	return "application/octet-stream";
}
</PRE>
<P>There is a lot missing from this method. For instance, nothing is returned 
for GIF or JPEG files. You may want to add the missing file types yourself, so 
that the components of your home page are sent with the content type correctly 
specified in the content type header line. For GIFs the MIME type is 
<CODE>image/gif</CODE> and for JPEGs it is <CODE>image/jpeg</CODE>. 
<P>This completes the code for the second phase of development of your Web 
server. Try running the server from the directory where your home page is 
located, and try viewing your home page files with a browser. Remember to 
include a port specifier in the URL of your home page, so that your browser 
doesn't try to connect to the default port 80. When you connect to the running 
web server with the browser, examine the GET message requests that the web 
server receives from the browser. </P></BODY></HTML>
